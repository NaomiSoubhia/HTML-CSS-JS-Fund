                <!-- Description of Polaroid's history -->
                <p>The Polaroid Corporation was an American company founded in 1937 by Edwin H. Land that became famous
                    for inventing the instant camera in 1948. Originally known as Land-Wheelwright Laboratories, the
                    company's initial business was based on Land's research into polarizing technology, which was used
                    for products like sunglasses and polarized lenses for military applications during WWII.
