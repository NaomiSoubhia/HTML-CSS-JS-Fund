            <summary><i>My pictures are coming out too dark or too bright</i></summary>
            <p>Lighting plays a big role in instant photography! Make sure you’re shooting in a well-lit environment.
                For best results, capture photos during the day or near a window. If using flash, keep your subject
                within 1–2 meters to ensure proper exposure.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary><i>The film isn’t developing correctly</i></summary>
            <p>Instant film is sensitive to light and temperature. After the photo prints, place it face-down for
                the first 90 seconds and avoid shaking it. Also, store unopened film in a cool place — around 13–18°C
                works best!</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary><i>My camera won’t turn on</i></summary>
            <p>Check if the battery is properly installed (or if the film pack includes a fresh battery). If the
                camera still doesn’t power up, remove the film pack and reinsert it securely — this refresh can often
                fix minor power issues.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary><i>My photos look blurry</i></summary>
            <p>Blurriness usually happens when the camera moves during shooting. Hold it steady with both hands and
                wait until the click is fully finished. Also make sure the subject isn’t too close — most Polaroids
                focus best from 60cm and beyond.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary><i>The film is stuck or not ejecting</i></summary>
            <p>Make sure nothing blocks the film slot. If the camera lights blink or click repeatedly, try turning
                the camera off and on again. Avoid pulling the film out manually — this can damage the rollers inside.
